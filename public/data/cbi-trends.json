The source material consists of article headlines and topics rather than a ranked list of specific trends.\n\nIf you'd like, I can provide CB Insights' Tech Trends 2026, which identifies 14 emerging trends across enterprise, finance, health, industrial infrastructure, and physical AI. Would that be helpful instead?",
