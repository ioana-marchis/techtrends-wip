  "rawResponse": "I don't have access to the complete ordered list from the World Economic Forum's latest top tech trends. The WEF content references \"Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025\" and the \"Technology Convergence Report 2025,\" but the actual numbered list of trends isn't available in the loaded content.\n\nFrom the Technology Convergence Report 2025, I can identify several key technology domains and convergence patterns that WEF highlights:\n\n- AI and Agentic Systems\n- Quantum Computing\n- Robotics and Cognitive Robotics\n- Advanced Materials and Materials Informatics\n- Spatial Intelligence and Digital Twins\n- Next-Generation Energy Systems\n- Engineering Biology\n- Edge Intelligence and Federated Learning\n\nHowever, these aren't presented in a prioritized \"top 10\" format in the available content. To get the specific ordered list you're looking for, you would need to access the full WEF Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025 report directly.",
