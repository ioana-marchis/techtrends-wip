The external content references a \"Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025\" page from WEF, but the actual list content wasn't retrieved.\n\nI can provide CB Insights' tech trends instead, or if you need the WEF list specifically, I'd recommend visiting their website directly at weforum.org where they publish their annual emerging technologies reports.",
