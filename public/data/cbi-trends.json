  "rawResponse": "I don't have access to the complete World Economic Forum's latest top tech trends list. The external content retrieved shows a reference to \"Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025\" from WEF, but the actual list content wasn't captured in the data.\n\nTo get you this information in the exact format you requested, I'd need the full WEF report or article that contains the ordered list of emerging technologies.\n\nIf you'd like, I can provide insights on emerging tech trends from CB Insights' research instead, which covers AI agents, physical AI, stablecoins going corporate, healthcare voice AI, and other significant 2026 trends based on our proprietary intelligence.",
