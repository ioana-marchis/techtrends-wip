  "rawResponse": "I found a reference to the World Economic Forum's \"Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025,\" but the actual list content isn't available in the sources I can access. The page exists but the specific trends aren't loaded in the data provided to me.\n\nI can't create an ordered list in the format you requested without the actual WEF data, as that would require me to fabricate information.\n\nHowever, I can help you explore emerging tech trends from CB Insights research if you're interested. We track technology trends across AI, quantum computing, fintech, digital health, and other major sectors with detailed analysis and data. Would that be helpful?",
